# Fractional Balanced Separator Settings ------------

# GaifmanNormal and HypergraphNormal seem to give the same optimal LP values
# But GaifmanBoosted one is slightly slower while giving smaller decompositions?? Maybe confirmation bias... 
#
# Using GaifmanNormal is a lot faster!

### Rounding settings ------------

#set to True to only use candidate sets that differ at least epsilon significantly in time to the previous one. 
#Faster, but less accurate.

#how much to give priority to separators that decrease a lot the size of the largest component. 
#1 means care about component size only, 0 means care about splitting root only. 0 is default.
#++could be worth adding a similar metric for reducing the fractional cover of the large component instead of the size?

#need to do statistical analysis of how well it does
vertexGainWeight = 0

# in gammaPlusFractionalCoverHeuristic, how much weight to give to the fractional cover of all vertices vs current root bag.
