Ran 60 out of 60 decompositions, using 1426.98 out of 3600 seconds

All decomposition widths = [7.0, 7.0, 7.0, 7.5, 7.0, 6.0, 7.5, 7.5, 7.0, 6.0, 6.0, 6.5, 6.5, 6.0, 5.5, 6.5, 5.5, 5.5, 6.5, 6.0, 6.0, 6.0, 7.0, 6.0, 6.5, 6.0, 6.5, 5.5, 6.0, 6.0, 7.0, 6.5, 6.5, 6.5, 6.0, 7.5, 6.0, 6.5, 6.0, 7.0, 7.0, 6.5, 7.0, 6.0, 7.5, 6.0, 6.5, 7.0, 6.0, 6.0, 6.0, 5.5, 7.5, 6.5, 5.5, 5.5, 6.0, 6.5, 5.5, 6.0]

best width = 5.5, which is decomposition index 14
best lower bound so far is 4.5, which is decomposition index 54
