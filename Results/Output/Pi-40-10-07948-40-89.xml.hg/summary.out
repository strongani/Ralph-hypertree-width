Ran 60 out of 60 decompositions, using 2846.09 out of 3600 seconds

All decomposition widths = [9.5, 9.5, 9.0, 7.5, 10.0, 12.0, 10.0, 8.5, 9.5, 10.5, 9.0, 9.0, 9.0, 8.0, 8.0, 9.5, 9.0, 9.5, 9.5, 8.5, 8.0, 9.0, 8.5, 9.0, 9.0, 9.5, 8.5, 9.5, 8.5, 9.0, 10.0, 10.0, 8.5, 8.5, 9.5, 8.5, 8.5, 8.0, 8.5, 9.5, 8.0, 10.0, 9.0, 8.5, 8.0, 8.5, 9.5, 8.5, 9.0, 8.5, 9.0, 8.5, 9.5, 9.0, 9.0, 9.0, 8.0, 8.5, 8.0, 8.5]

best width = 7.5, which is decomposition index 3
best lower bound so far is 5.5, which is decomposition index 52
