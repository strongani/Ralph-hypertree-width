Ran 60 out of 60 decompositions, using 1548.38 out of 3600 seconds

All decomposition widths = [7.0, 7.5, 7.0, 7.0, 6.0, 8.5, 6.5, 10.0, 8.0, 8.0, 7.0, 6.0, 7.0, 6.5, 8.0, 6.5, 6.5, 7.5, 6.5, 7.0, 7.5, 7.5, 8.0, 7.0, 7.0, 8.0, 5.5, 6.5, 7.0, 8.0, 7.0, 8.0, 7.5, 8.0, 6.5, 6.0, 6.5, 8.0, 7.5, 6.0, 8.0, 7.0, 7.0, 7.5, 8.0, 7.5, 7.0, 7.5, 6.5, 6.5, 6.5, 6.0, 7.5, 6.5, 6.0, 6.5, 6.0, 6.0, 6.0, 7.5]

best width = 5.5, which is decomposition index 26
best lower bound so far is 5.0, which is decomposition index 51
