Ran 60 out of 60 decompositions, using 999.12 out of 3600 seconds

All decomposition widths = [4.0, 6.0, 5.5, 5.0, 5.5, 4.5, 7.0, 4.0, 6.5, 6.0, 5.0, 5.5, 6.5, 5.5, 5.0, 5.5, 5.5, 5.5, 5.0, 6.0, 5.5, 5.5, 5.5, 6.0, 4.0, 5.5, 6.0, 5.5, 5.0, 6.0, 5.0, 5.5, 6.5, 5.5, 5.0, 6.5, 6.5, 6.0, 5.5, 4.0, 5.0, 4.0, 5.0, 5.0, 6.5, 5.5, 6.0, 5.5, 5.0, 5.5, 5.0, 5.5, 5.5, 5.0, 4.5, 5.5, 5.0, 5.0, 4.5, 5.0]

best width = 4.0, which is decomposition index 0
best lower bound so far is 3.0, which is decomposition index 50
