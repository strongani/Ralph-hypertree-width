Ran 60 out of 60 decompositions, using 584.43 out of 3600 seconds

All decomposition widths = [3.5, 4.0, 4.0, 5.0, 4.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.0, 3.5, 4.0, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5]

best width = 3.5, which is decomposition index 0
best lower bound so far is 3.0, which is decomposition index 54
