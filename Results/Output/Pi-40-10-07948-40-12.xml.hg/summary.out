Ran 60 out of 60 decompositions, using 3127.57 out of 3600 seconds

All decomposition widths = [10.0, 13.5, 8.5, 10.5, 10.5, 11.0, 10.5, 10.5, 11.0, 9.0, 9.0, 9.0, 9.0, 10.0, 9.0, 8.5, 9.5, 10.5, 9.5, 10.0, 9.0, 10.0, 9.0, 10.5, 8.0, 8.5, 8.5, 9.5, 9.0, 11.0, 10.0, 8.5, 9.5, 8.0, 10.0, 9.5, 7.5, 9.5, 9.5, 7.5, 7.5, 9.5, 8.5, 9.0, 9.0, 11.0, 9.5, 9.0, 10.5, 9.5, 8.5, 8.5, 7.5, 9.0, 9.5, 8.0, 7.5, 9.0, 8.5, 8.5]

best width = 7.5, which is decomposition index 36
best lower bound so far is 6.0, which is decomposition index 56
