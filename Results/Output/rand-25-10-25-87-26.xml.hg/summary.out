Ran 60 out of 60 decompositions, using 2366.96 out of 3600 seconds

All decomposition widths = [8.0, 9.0, 8.5, 9.5, 7.5, 7.0, 6.5, 8.5, 7.0, 7.5, 7.0, 7.5, 7.5, 6.0, 6.5, 7.0, 7.0, 6.0, 7.0, 7.5, 6.0, 7.5, 7.0, 7.0, 6.5, 6.0, 6.5, 6.5, 7.0, 7.0, 7.0, 7.0, 7.0, 6.5, 6.5, 6.5, 7.0, 7.5, 6.5, 6.5, 7.0, 6.0, 7.5, 6.5, 7.0, 7.5, 7.0, 6.5, 6.5, 6.0, 6.0, 7.0, 6.0, 5.5, 6.5, 6.5, 7.0, 6.0, 6.5, 6.5]

best width = 5.5, which is decomposition index 53
best lower bound so far is 4.5, which is decomposition index 57
