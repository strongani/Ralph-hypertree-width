Ran 60 out of 60 decompositions, using 1470.33 out of 3600 seconds

All decomposition widths = [8.5, 6.5, 7.0, 7.0, 6.5, 5.5, 7.0, 6.5, 6.5, 6.5, 6.5, 6.0, 6.5, 6.0, 7.0, 6.0, 5.0, 6.0, 6.5, 5.0, 5.5, 7.5, 6.0, 6.5, 5.5, 5.5, 6.0, 6.0, 6.0, 7.0, 7.0, 6.0, 6.5, 6.5, 6.0, 6.0, 6.0, 6.5, 5.5, 6.5, 5.5, 6.5, 6.5, 6.5, 5.5, 6.5, 6.5, 6.0, 7.0, 6.0, 5.0, 6.0, 5.5, 5.5, 6.0, 5.0, 6.0, 5.5, 5.0, 5.5]

best width = 5.0, which is decomposition index 16
best lower bound so far is 4.0, which is decomposition index 50
